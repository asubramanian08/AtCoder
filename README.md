# AtCoder

## About
Similar to [Codeforces](https://github.com/asubramanian08/Codeforces), I take [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) tests to practice for [USACO](https://github.com/asubramanian08/USACO) and also to try and improve my actually rating. See my [profile](https://atcoder.jp/users/magmamite135) in the [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) page.

## Format
To find the problems on the [AtCoder website](https://atcoder.jp) use enter the URL "https://atcoder.jp/contests/(folderName)/". Furthermore, to my standings enter "https://atcoder.jp/contests/(folderName)/standings?watching=Magmamite135".

If I take an "Official" (rated) test then the top of the file will say "Official: " followed by the status of the code (Correct, Incorrect, ...)
